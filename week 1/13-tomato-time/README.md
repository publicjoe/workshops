# Tomato Time Reflection

I achieved all of the requirements plus some of the stretch suggestions.

I found getting the flexbox layout to be the most challenging, but a quick re-read of the moodle text soon had me back to understanding what it was I was using.

I did not have any errors or bugs, however sourcing images for the social media icons with transparent backgrounds was interesting, then getting them to be the same size without spending a load of time in an image editor took a few extra minutes.

This was a fun little assignment
