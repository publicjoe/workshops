    <p>The UK inflation rate fell to 3.6% in the year to October, but food prices rose again following a dip in September.</p>
    <p>Prices are rising at their slowest pace for four months, helped by smaller rises in household energy costs and lower hotel costs, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.</p>
    <p>Economists had expected a slightly bigger fall from September's 3.8% to 3.5%.</p>
    <p>The latest inflation report comes just a week ahead of the government's much-anticipated Budget.</p>
